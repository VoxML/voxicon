<p>As part of the 16th Joint ACL - ISO Workshop on Interoperable Semantic Annotation (ISA), taking place at LREC 2020 in
  Marseille, France, we are soliciting image annotations as part of a proposal to develop VoxML into an ISO Standard for the
  representation of visual information.  More information about ISA and the VoxML special track can be found
  <a href="https://sigsem.uvt.nl/isa16/">here</a> and the dataset for the shared task is posted
